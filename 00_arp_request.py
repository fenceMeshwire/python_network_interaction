# Purpose:
# Concept of showing IP addresses of local machines within your private owned network.
# The ARP is used to find the MAC address of the neighbors in a network. 

# This can be achieved much easier, by typing 'arp -a' in the command line 
# if you work on a windows computer.

# Dependency
